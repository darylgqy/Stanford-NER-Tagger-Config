"Singapore has also registered our concerns with the relevant US and China departments and is continuing to engage them," said the spokesperson, who did not respond to a query on the number of firms affected.

In January, US President Donald Trump's administration fired its opening salvo at imported washing machines and solar panels, on the basis that these foreign products are a "substantial cause of serious injury to domestic manufacturers (in the US)".

While targeted primarily at China and South Korea, the tariffs on solar panels and washers — as well as those imposed on aluminium and steel last month — punish firms worldwide, except those that have been granted exemptions.

Within a few months, the number of products affected by the US-China trade war has grown to now stand at over 1,500, amounting to a combined US$100 billion worth of trade between the two economic superpowers.

At the same time, the White House is also waging other trade wars with Canada, Mexico and the European Union (EU).

The MTI spokesperson said that the ongoing trade war between the US and China has had “limited" direct negative impact on Singapore's economy to date.

The ministry estimates that a "modest" 0.1 per cent of the Republic’s domestic exports are affected by the tariffs.

Still, the Government remains "concerned" by the tariff measures taken by the world's two biggest economies, and the mounting trade tensions between them.

"These can have negative spillover effects on global supply chains and dampen investor and consumer confidence, in turn weighing on global growth... We hope that countries will exercise restraint and avoid further escalation of tensions," said the spokesperson.
